# Ideas

We have too many duplicate tools. _Ideas_ is a project trying to redirect this misdirected energy by tracking ideas needed by the infosec community. We review submissions to ensure no other tools exist out there that already cover the user's idea. By doing this we reduce the amount of time wasted by tool developers. The goal is to allow researchers to share their ideas, and allow developers to find ideas for tools to build.

This project is actively maintained by [Mohammed Diaa](https://twitter.com/mhmdiaa) and [EdOverflow](https://twitter.com/EdOverflow).

### Using the issue tracker 💡

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for features requests. Please ensure that your ticket uses the _Ideas_ template before submitting it.

### Issues and labels 🏷

The bug tracker utilizes several labels to help organize and identify individual tickets.

### Guidelines for submissions 📝

- Use the GitHub issue search — check if the idea has already been submitted in the past. Please try not to submit a duplicate ticket. We encourage contributors to use the old ticket first before creating a new one.
- Submission titles should be in the following format: `A tool to {{function}}`, where `{{function}}` describes the tool's purpose (e.g., `A tool to crawl web applications to find XSS vulnerabilities.`)
